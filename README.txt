Data Analyzer

This java program pulls in four different text files and reorganizes the data in four different ways, depending on the users preferance.
The file named "Complete" includes every class (reconfigured) and operates as though every class has been downloaded.  The user chooses between
a word search, author search, an alphabetized list of the authors, or a collection of every post, author, and their word counts, comments, and score.
The user also inputs the name of the text file they wish to save the results to.  This organizer is, however, only usable with the given text files.
